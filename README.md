# StardewValley DynamicShadows
 Mod to change the direction of shadows based on time of day. It does this by scaling the existing shadow image horizontally and ofsetting it based on the time of day.
 
 Additional features I'd like to add
 - Seasonal direction changes
 - Rotate shadow as well instead of just skewing horizontally
 - Change shadows based on interior
